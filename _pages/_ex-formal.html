  - title: A letter from our founders
    style: xl
  - paragraph: As the world slowly and thankfully emerges from COVID-19’s grip, there is no doubt that at Secret Escapes, these have been the most challenging months of our working lives.
  - paragraph: Despite tireless efforts from our incredible customer services team, supported by willing volunteers from all over the business, we struggled to respond to the pandemic’s seismic impact.  Many of you, our customers, did not get your questions answered promptly or clearly enough. As a business with a history of excellent customer satisfaction, this is an uncomfortable truth that we must recognise.  We apologise to those members who have had to wait to get a satisfactory resolution.  Our single, biggest business priority remains looking after those of you whose plans have been disrupted and whilst the process still isn’t perfect, it’s getting better every day.
  - paragraph: Yet, crisis demands creativity too. We are so proud to be helping over 50,000 customers postpone and rebook hotel trips - using a process invented in days, staffed by a dedicated team that continues to work around the clock.
  - paragraph: We are also responding rapidly to changing travel priorities.  Flexibility has become key to helping people feel confident enough to book, so we have created a brand new range of Refundable deals.  These deals are fully refundable up to 8 days before travel, with no penalty.  We continue to bring you incredible prices too, because we have structured our deals thoughtfully and chosen our partners carefully.  Restricted air travel means you will find these Refundable deals currently located closer to home, which in turn helps us support our local hotels and regions.
  - paragraph: As well as financial peace of mind, our new ‘SafeStay’ policy has been developed to make your travel as safe as possible.  We are working with all our hotels to ensure they comply with public health regulations in their local areas.  For as long as social distancing impacts travel, your health comes first. Find our ‘SafeStay’ policy here.
  - paragraph: Finally, we hope you will make use of our ‘Welcome back’ promotion.  This offers you future savings, as a thank you for sticking with us during this difficult period.  At Secret Escapes, COVID-19 has left us wiser and better prepared for the future and whenever you are ready to travel again, we can’t wait to welcome you back.
  - paragraph: Alex and Tom
