  intro:
    - banner-title: Example offer card layouts
      image: banner.jpg
      content: The structure of how offers flow into the template blocks has changed in version 2. Now the same groups that are used for showing normal content can be used for offers, and you just have to assign the type to "offer" on the include. This will pull in the content block for offer details, as well as link to the offer image.



  feature-offers:
    - title: Large offer cards



  full-width-offers:
    - title: Full width offer cards



  two-column-offers:
    - title: Two column offer cards



  styling-offers:
    - title: Styling offer cards
      content-rows:
        - content: "Simple styling of the offer cards is done inline through attributes on the includes."
        - content: "Possible attributes are: <strong>title-style</strong> (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6), <strong>paragraph-style</strong> (lead, small), <strong>button-style</strong> (large, small, subtle), <strong>align</strong> (left, center, right)"
        - content: "To change the <strong>subtitle-style</strong> you have to have a title setting (this is a strange limitation of Jekyll as far as I can tell). subtitle-style options are the same as title: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6"
