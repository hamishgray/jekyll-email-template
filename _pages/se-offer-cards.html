      content: The structure of how offers flow into the template blocks has changed in version 2. Now the same groups that are used for showing normal content can be used for offers, and you just have to assign the type to "offer" on the include. This will pull in the content block for offer details, as well as link to the offer image.

  full-width-offers:
