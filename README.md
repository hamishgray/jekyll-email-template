# Email generator

Using Jekyll and Gulp this system allows us to generate consistent branded emails built on the Secret Escapes DLS foundation. This includes trading emails, general communication, announcements and partnership campaign templates.



## Template hierarchy

#### 1. Communication
Beginning with the simplest, the communication template is intended to be used for purely information updates that are not focused on conversion or interaction.

The template consists of:
- Logo
- Content body / 600px width
- Footer / Best wishes
- Footer / Quicklinks
- Footer / Legal


#### 2. Trading
The general trading email is for use in normal day-to-day emailing of deals. It allows for a title and message that is relevant to the days selection before presenting a long list of deals.

The template consists of:
- Black header / Logo
- Black header / Title & introduction
- Deals list and content / 600px width
- Footer / Promo
- Footer / Quicklinks
- Footer / Legal


#### 3. Promotion
This is an evolution of the trading template built to carry a stronger promotional message with a high impact design. It is to be used sparingly so that it doesn't begin to feel normal to customers.

The template introduces an image area below the title which can be expanded to any height. This allows for integrating a destination image, or campaign creative as necessary. Along with this is an overlapping content block to present the campaign message in full.

The template consists of:
- Black header / Logo
- Black header / Title & introduction
- Hero image / Extendable height
- Hero content / Content block
- Deals list and content / 600px width
- Footer / Promo
- Footer / Quicklinks
- Footer / Legal


#### 4. Super
The premium template, this is to be reserved for truly hero campaigns where we want maximum cut-through. It should be used for important campaigns such as Black Friday or Valentines Day which run across multiple channels as a company-wide initiative.

The differentiator for this template is the high impact banner which presents a large image with the logo overlaid at the top. It can be extended to any height, to house highly engaging imagery or a campaign creative.

Text content is kept separate from the image to allow full creative control over image selection, without concern over placement and legibility of text. The logo and text still feel integrated however with fades on top and bottom.

The template consists of:
- Banner / Logo
- Banner / Hero image
- Banner / Title & content on black
- Deals list and content / 600px width
- Footer / Promo
- Footer / Quicklinks
- Footer / Legal
